# Fishing Game Prototype

At the time, I was really enjoying the game [Dredge](https://www.dredge.game/), so I built a similar prototype in Godot.

## Why Godot?

At first glance, Godot didn't look like something I wanted to develop in.

Working in a proprietary language like GDScript doesn't stand out to me as it has no transferrable skills.

But then the Unity fiasco happened where they tried to change their licensing on game developers, and
Godot was put under the spotlight.

I realized that you could build in .NET C#, and that's a language I wanted experience with.

It turned out that the engine is incredibly fun to work with in C#, and when I've encountered errors
or limitations in the engine, I've been able to inspect the source code.

Godot is a huge win for open source software.

## The hardest features

Many of the things that looked simple turned out not to be.

But this is how software usually goes.

### Multiple Input Methods

Support for both Keyboard/Mouse and Controller takes some abstraction in any object that listens for events.

### Split-screen

I had to refactor all my components so they didn't make any assumptions about their parents, or which player they correspond to.

### Waves and buoyancy

The math is a bit hard to read about and implement.

### Inventory

There's a surprising amount of edge cases when it comes to snapping items to a grid.

This gets more complicated when we consider how to move a grabbed item from one grid to another.

Then add on another layer where items are different shapes, sizes, and can be rotated.

The UI needs to reject an attempt to move a 3x3 object to a 2x2 grid, for example.
