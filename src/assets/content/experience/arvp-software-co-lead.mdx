As co-lead of the software team, I managed a team of 3-8 core developers.

I ran weekly meetings, provided project direction and mentorship.

I personally oversaw:
- Overhauling the onboarding process of our new members with a more hands-on approach
- Improving our documentation with a BookStack instance
- Organizing tasks with Trello
- Experimenting with stereo cameras for spatial mapping as required to control a mechanical claw
- Integrating robot software with a simulator built on Gazebo
- Training instance segmentation models for computer vision, and integration them into the vision stack
