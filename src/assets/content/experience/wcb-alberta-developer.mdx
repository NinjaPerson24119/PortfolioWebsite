Paired with another developer to revitalize an insurance claim calculation web-app built with React / ASP.NET MVC / Microsoft SQL Server.

Exceeded expectations by developing calculation workflows for two new claim types ahead of schedule.

We accomplished this by first refactoring the existing code to a more scalable structure, and I optimized the webpack build process to complete in \<1s versus the original 30s by configuring it to run on multiple threads. Optimizing the build saved an estimated 2 developer weeks.
