ARVP taught me the software engineering skills that my degree did not: Git/GitHub, developing in a team environment, and a lot more.

I focused on conventional computer vision strategies, and later learned to use deep learning (YOLO) to allow the team's AUV to "see" objects underwater.
Some parts of this involved writing GPU code with CUDA, interfacing with Darknet (C Library) to run neural models we trained, and processing images with OpenCV.

Assisted with the mission planner (a state machine representing the robot's actions), mapping system, and GUIs for those operating the robot.

Attended RoboSub 2018-2019. The team won 4th out of 56 international teams in 2019, winning $2k.
